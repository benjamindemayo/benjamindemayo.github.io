## About Benny
I am a graduate student in the [Human Diversity Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/scdlab/about-us/) and the [Baby Lab](https://babylab.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, where I am advised by [Kristina Olson](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/kristina-olson) and [Casey Lew-Williams](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/casey-lew-williams). I'm interested in how children learn about social concepts such as gender and race, with a particular emphasis on how a child's language environment - at home, in school and in their community - shapes this learning.

Before grad school, I received my B.A. in psychology at Stanford University, where I pursued independent research with (and later lab managed for) [Dr. Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the [Stanford Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu). In my free time, I am a classical clarinet player and [love to cook](https://www.instagram.com/bennyd_eats/).
